        <h5 class="description text-center nz-about-me-description">
            My first paid exposure to development was working under a software engineer for Cisco,
            the experience was invaluable.
            I knew my interest in the field was real when I developed
            a storyboard app to propose to my wife, and was successful. <br><br>

            For about 3 years, I worked in graphic design and web development.
            You can find my graphic work in Canadian Jewellers and Business Jewellers magazines, Las Vegas jewelry tradeshow,
            Hong Kong jewelry tradeshow, and more. <br><br>

            At this point in my developer journey, I am enjoying my exposure
            to Javascript and frameworks like Angular.<br><br>
            I’m enthralled with it’s ability to have control over and influence the user experience.
            Looking for opportunities to grow in this area and strengthen my backend abilities.</h5>
